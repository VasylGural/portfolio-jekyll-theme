# Vasyl Gural

Hello, I'm Vasyl Gural, based in the vibrant city of Bristol, United Kingdom. My educational journey began with a BSc in Physics at the University of Bristol, though I shifted focus before completing the program to pursue my passion for data analytics. Currently, I am diving deep into the world of analytics, combining my analytical mindset with a growing expertise in data-driven insights.

In the data analytics industry, I have undertaken projects like Exploring the Relationship Between Air Quality and Real Estate in California, which highlights my interest in uncovering meaningful trends and actionable insights. My ultimate goal is to master data analytics skills, allowing me to solve complex problems and make impactful contributions.

Beyond professional aspirations, I have a keen personal interest in financial analysis, where I explore the intersection of data and economic decision-making. This interest fuels my drive to continually learn and adapt in a rapidly evolving field.
